	<h2>INDUS VALLEY</h2>
	<p> The Vedic Period (c. 1500 – c. 500 BCE) is postulated to have formed during the 1500 BCE to 800 BCE. As Indo-Aryans migrated and settled into the Indus Valley, along with them came their distinctive religious traditions and practices which fused with local culture.he Indo-Aryans religious beliefs and practices from the Bactria–Margiana Culture and the native Harappan Indus beliefs of the former Indus Valley Civilisation eventually gave rise to Vedic culture and tribes.The initial early Vedic culture was a tribal, pastoral society centered in the Indus Valley, of what is today Pakistan. During this period the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, were composed.</p>
	<p>Several early tribes and kingdoms arose during this period and internecine military conflicts between these various tribes was common; as described in the Rig Veda, which was being composed at this time, the most notable of such conflicts was the Battle of Ten Kings. This battle took place on the banks of the River Ravi in the 14th century BC (1300 BCE). The battle was fought between the Bharatas tribe and a confederation of ten tribes:</p>

<h2>Achaemenid Empire</h2>
<p>The main Vedic tribes remaining in the Indus Valley by 550 BC were the Kamboja, Sindhu, Taksas of Gandhara, the Madras and Kathas of the River Chenab, Mallas of the River Ravi and Tugras of the River Sutlej. These several tribes and principalities fought against one another to such an extent that the Indus Valley no longer had one powerful Vedic tribal kingdom to defend against outsiders and to wield the warring tribes into one organized kingdom. The area was wealthy and fertile, yet infighting led misery and despair. King Pushkarasakti of Gandhara was engaged in power struggles against his local rivals and as such the Khyber Pass remained poorly defended. King Darius I of the Achaemenid Empire took advantage of the opportunity and planned for an invasion.</p>
<p>The Indus Valley was fabled in Persia for its gold and fertile soil and conquering it had been a major objective of his predecessor Cyrus The Great.[31] In 542 BC, Cyrus had led his army and conquered the Makran coast in southern Balochistan. However, he is known to have campaigned beyond Makran (in the regions of Kalat, Khuzdar and Panjgur) and lost most of his army in the Gedrosian Desert (speculated today as the Kharan Desert).</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhara#Part_of_Achaemenid_Empire" target='_blank'>Gandhara</a>satrapy, established 518 BC with its capital at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushkalavati" target=_blank>Pushkalavati</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charsadda" target="_blank">(Charsadda)</a>. Gandhara Satrapy was established in the general region of the old Gandhara grave culture, in what is today <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa" target="_blank">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</a>. During Achaemenid rule, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharosthi" target="_blank">Kharosthi</a> alphabet, derived from the one used for Aramaic (the official language of Achaemenids), developed here and remained the national script of Gandhara until 200 AD.</li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindush" target='_blank'>Hindush</a>satrapy, established in 518 BC with its capital at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxila" target="_blank">Taxila</a>. The satrapy was established in upper Punjab (presumably in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potohar_plateau" target="_blank">Potohar plateau</a> region).</li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachosia" target='_blank'>Arachosia</a>satrapy, established in 517 BC with its capital at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar" target="_blank">Kandahar</a>. Arachosia was one of the larger provinces covering much of lower Punjab, southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of modern-day Pakistan and Helmand province of what is today <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan" target="_blank">Afghanistan</a>. The inhabitants of Arachosia were referred to as Paktyans by ethnicity, and that name may have been in reference to the ethnic Pax̌tūn (Pashtun) tribes.</li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sattagydia" target='_blank'>Sattagydia</a>satrapy, established in 516 BC in what is today <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh" target="_blank">Sindh</a>. Sattagydia is mentioned for the first time in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_inscription" target="_blank">Behistun inscription</a> of Darius the Great as one of the provinces in revolt while the king was in Babylon. The revolt was presumably suppressed in 515 BC. The satrapy disappears from sources after 480 BC, possibly being mentioned by another name or included with other regions.</li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedrosia" target='_blank'>Gedrosia</a> satrapy, established in 542 BC, covered much of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makran" target="_blank">Makran</a> region of southern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan" target="_blank">Balochistan</a>. It had been conquered much earlier by Cyrus The Great.</li>

</ul>
<p>Despite all this, there is no archaeological evidence of Achaemenid control over these region as not a single archaeological site that can be positively identified with the Achaemenid Empire has been found anywhere in Pakistan, including at Taxila. What is known about the easternmost satraps and borderlands of the Achaemenid Empire is alluded to in the Darius inscriptions and from Greek sources such as the Histories of Herodotus and the later Alexander Chronicles (Arrian, Strabo et al.). These sources list three Indus Valley tributaries or conquered territories that were subordinated to the Persian Empire and made to pay tributes to the Persian Kings: Gandhara, Sattagydia and Hindush.</p>
